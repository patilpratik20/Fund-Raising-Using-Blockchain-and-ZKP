# Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform
This project aims to develop a system for land management with the following characteristics:
1. To register new users to the system with previously owned property
2. The user can buy and sell the property.
3. Proof Of Work(PoW) consensus algorithm is incorporated to improve the security of the blockchain.
4. Implementation of Merkle tree to calculate root hash of all the transactions inside a block.
5. User can view the transaction history that is related to a property.
